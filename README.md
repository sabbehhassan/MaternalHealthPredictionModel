Maternal Health Prediction Model
Overview
The Maternal Health Prediction Model is a web-based application designed to predict maternal health risks during pregnancy. It uses machine learning to analyze input data and provide risk assessments, helping in early detection and prevention of complications.

Features
✔️ User-friendly web interface (Vue.js)
✔️ Maternal health risk prediction (Flask & Machine Learning)
✔️ Fast and secure data processing
✔️ Interactive result display
✔️ Easy-to-use data input form

Technology Stack
Frontend: Vue.js, HTML, CSS
Backend: Flask (Python)
Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
Database (if needed): SQLite or PostgreSQL
Version Control: Git & GitHub
How It Works?
User inputs health data (e.g., age, BMI, blood pressure).
The model processes the data and predicts health risks.
Results are displayed with a clear risk assessment.
